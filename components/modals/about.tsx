						The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more
						productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to
						break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
						separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,
						from the Italian word for "tomato", after the tomato-shaped kitchen
						timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
